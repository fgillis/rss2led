Rndr_Site:

Sends render information to afcg web site server.

1. Update "public_html/rndr_site/index.shtml" on the server.
2. Create "public_html/rndr_site/JOB" directory on the server.
3. Update the "DIREC" and "SLEEP" variables in "rndr_site.sh".

The shell will output temp/ftp.cmd and several temp files that get combined to create "rndr_view.shtml" which
gets ftp'd to the appropriate directory on the server.

Go to www.afcg.com/rndr_site to view render details.

This process currently defaults to checking render hosts "w3" only.
To change this, edit the "HOSTS" variable in "${LOCAL_BIN}/rndr_site".
